# Quantum Transport in Nanoporous Graphene (NPG)
*A study in Quantum transport simulations in novel nanoporous graphene.*

This repository contains the code used to simulate electron transport in pertubed npgs of various designs. The project consists of 2 phases:
1. Phase:\
  To build Jupyter notebooks able to simulate simple electron transport using tightbinding models and Green's functions.
2. Phase:\
  To write code capable of larger simulations using SIESTA and TBTrans, suitable for High-performance-clusters.
