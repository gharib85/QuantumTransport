In this section a range of tests will be conducted on different NPG structures in order to uncover the effect of chemical modification of the bridges between the Graphene Nano Ribbons (GNR's) in the NPG. From an applied perspective, one of the main motivations is to find out how these bridges can be chemically modified in order to control the current through the material. A recent study\cite{unpub}, submitted for publication in JACS\footnote{\href{https://pubs.acs.org/journal/jacsat}{Journal of American Chemical Society}}, has shown how one could possibly confine current flow to a single GNR channel by modification of bridges between GNR's in NPG utilising \textit{Quantum Interference} (QI) effects (See \cref{studyfig3}). This provides a solution to an important requirement in carbon-based nanocircuitry design, namely nano confinement of electron flow. The study was focused on the difference in effect of having \textit{meta} and \textit{para} bridges between GNR's. Meta and para bridges are essentially benzene rings connected in two different ways (See \cref{Metaparastructfig}). The meta and para bridges are 'static' cases in the sense that once made through organic synthesis, they are not interchangeable. However, if the bridges are functionalised with oxygen they become sensitive to f.ex. hydrogenation in basic/acidic environments, which tends to affect QI. Thus by hydrogenation it will be possible to tune the electrical properties of the material and make it sensitive to external environments. Studies\cite{li_single_2019} show that hydrogenation of specific sites on nano meter scale is possible experimentally. By the use of the functions developed in previous sections, this section will try to uncover what happens when oxygen is added to the benzene rings in the meta and para bridges. Subsequently hydrogenation of the oxygen will be tested. Following is a section introducing para and meta NPG in detail.

\subsection{Differences in para and meta bridges}\label{metaparasection}
In broad terms the difference in the \textit{meta} and \textit{para} structures lies in the path an electron will travel through the benzene ring to get across the bridge between GNR's in NPG. In the para bridge, the path across the aromatic ring is symmetric and so the electron will pass above or below with equal probability. Since the para bridge has three bonds in each direction across the ring, the path length in the para bridge is the same on each side (See \cref{Metaparastructfig} a)). This will cause constructive QI of the states once the waves meet on the other side of the ring. Which for para NPG causes electronic coupling between the GNR channels. For the meta bridge the way across the aromatic ring is not symmetric in the sense that there is two bonds across the path below and four bonds across on the path above (See \cref{Metaparastructfig} b)). This will cause a shift by half a wavelength between the two paths and thus create destructive QI between waves meeting on the other side of the ring. In the meta NPG, this causes electronic decoupling between GNR channels, allowing for confinement of injected currents in a single GNR channel\cite{unpub}. In \cref{metapara} band plots as well as transmission plots are shown for para and meta NPG. In the band plots the two sets of valence/conduction bands around the fermi level shows a shift for para and interference for meta NPG. Looking at the transmission plots directly below one can see there is transmission  and thus coupling of the states between the GNR's for para. The area between the two peaks at \SI{0.5}{\electronvolt} and  \SI{1.2}{\electronvolt} show transport between the GNR's. In the transmission plot for meta the transmission is confined. In the transmission plot the area between the two peaks is now pretty much 0. This means that  states occurs between GNR's are decoupled in meta system. To summarise these results qualitatively: Shifts of the bands in the band plots, corresponds to effective coupling of the states between the GNR's. Bands on top of each other, showing QI, corresponds decoupling of the states to a single GNR thus decoupling states between GNR's. In the following sections, band plots will mainly be used to show results. Therefore one should keep in mind how the band structures, qualitatively, relate to transmission. In \cref{appfigs}, \cref{allbands} a figure obtained from the developed functions with band plots of normal, para and meta NPG can be seen.

\subsection{Tests with modified meta and para NPG}\label{test1}
The tests consist of two kinds of chemical modification. Firstly it will be adding oxygen sites to the meta and para NPG (Addition of Oxygen will be simulated by addition of another carbon site to the structure, effectively adding another pi-electron). Secondly simulations of hydrogenation will be done by having added hydroxide groups. By removing hydroxide sites entirely, the aim is to simulate the removal of the extra pi-electron which the oxygen originally provided, but now lost by hydrogenation. These modifications will be carried out separately. The band plots obtained via DFT makes it hard to understand what is actually going on in the system chemically. Therefore the aim is to show that using the methods developed, based on Tight Binding models, it is possible to reproduce bands structures calculated from DFT. If successful, it will provide a much easier way to understand the effect of the implemented chemical modification compared to the DFT approach. Band plots, as well as some on-site potential maps, calculated with DFT has been provided by \textit{Isaac} for comparison. The geometries, on which the calculations are used, are optimised by DFT. They will also be provided by \textit{ISAAC}.
\subsection{Test 1: Para-O\mathinhead{_4}{_4}-NPG}
In the first test is considering the Para-O\(_4\)-NPG. The basis structure is para-NPG where 4 oxygen sites are bonded, two on each benzene ring (See \cref{PS4OOW} ). The fist thing to notice is that in \cref{PS4ODFT} the valence band show QI and thus decouples the GNR's. So in spite having a para bridge, decoupling occurs when oxygen in bonded to the ring. To simulate this practically, the developed method considers the bonded oxygen as carbon atoms. It does not differentiate between the type of atoms only the distance between them. As a baseline the potential of these atoms are thus the same. Moreover, the hydrogen, included in the provided optimised geometries, will be removed before any calculations take place. In \cref{PS4Odevnomod} one can see the resulting band structure plot, where calculations have been carried out, using only the provided geometry. No modifications where made. The band plot does not show much resemblance with the one obtained, using DFT. It is pretty much symmetric around the fermi level and it is hard to make out whether there is coupling or decoupling between GNR's. This is expected. As seen in the potential map of \cref{potmapPS4O}, the sites where the oxygen is bonded, have a potential much different from that of the rest of the system (the four dark blue spots). As mentioned, the baseline of the method does not take into account differentiating on-site potentials within a cell. So to compensate for this, the on-site potential of the four bonded oxygen is changed. In \cref{PS4Odevmod} one can see the resulting band plot after the on-site potential of the bonded oxygen has been change to \SI{-0.50}{\electronvolt}. The resulting band plot resembles the DFT calculations much more. There is now QI in the valence bands which means decoupling of the GNR's.

\subsection{Test 2: P-(OH)\mathinhead{_4}{_4}-NPG}\label{test2}
Next test will be with the P-(OH)\(_4\)-NPG system. Again the basis structure is para-NPG with added oxygen, but here the aim is to simulate hydrogenation, so therefore the oxygen atoms added will become hydroxide groups (See \cref{PS4OHOW}). The DFT plot in \cref{PS4OHDFT} shows a shift in the valence/conduction bands, so the GNR's have been coupled again. Here the approach is to try use the applied on-site potential for the bonded oxygen from the previous test (\cref{test1}) as a baseline. This is on the assumption that oxygen still contribute to the pi-conjugated system. In \cref{PS4OHmod2} the resulting band plot can be seen. It shows exactly the same as \cref{PS4Odevmod}. What one can conclude for this is that even though the geometries provided are optimised with DFT specifically for each system, the developed method does not distinguish the small differences in distance between atoms, which leads to hopping. The result is that, seen from a tight binding point of view, the geometries are the same initially even though they have been optimised individually with DFT. Therefore the resulting plots are identical. A natural way to compensate for this is to change the on-site potential by a value significantly lower, so that hopping can occur. Using the potential plot in \cref{potmapPS4OH} as a guide the on-sties of the oxygen are changed to \SI{-2}{\electronvolt}. The resulting plot can be seen in \cref{PS4OHdevmod}. The plot show good agreement with the DFT. The bands have shifted again and the GNR's are coupled. This means hydrogenation decouples the oxygen, so by lowering the on-site potential of one can get effective decoupling of oxygen. As seen this gives a satisfying result. Now that it is known that hydrogenation decouples the oxygen, a last hypothesis is that by removing the hydroxide group entirely, before calculation, the result will be similar to \cref{PS4OHdevmod}. In \cref{PS4OHremove} the resulting plot can be seen. As hypothesised, the resulting band plot show resemblance with both the DFT and \cref{PS4OHdevmod} \cref{PS4OHdevmod}. So the decoupling of oxygen by hydrogenation can be simulated, simply by removing the hydroxide group entirely. Again there is shifts in the bands and thus coupling of the GNR's. This means that the developed method can uncover what happens chemically when the NPG is hydrogenated and it can do so in a simple manner.

\subsection{Test 3: Meta-NPG with oxygen added symmetrically}\label{test3}
Moving on to the meta NPG, the test is going to be exactly the same as \cref{test1}. To see the structure of the system look in \cref{MS2OOW}. Recall from \cref{metaparasection} that the meta NPG gives rise to QI and thus decoupling of the GNR's. However as seen in \cref{test1}, functionalising the bridges with oxygen caused some quantum interference in the para and thus decoupling of the GNR's in para NPG. The expected outcome of this test is that by functionalisation the meta NPG bridges with oxygen will give rise to shifts in the bands and coupling of the GNR's. First the DFT plot in \cref{MS2ODFT} show that there is indeed a shift in the valence and that it is bigger than the shift in the conduction band. So by functionalising with oxygen the effect is most prevalent at the valence band for both para and meta. In \cref{MS2Odevnomod} the blot for the system with no modification is shown. Here one can also so see shifts in the valence and conduction bands. However, the plot is totally symmetric around 0 so it is not entirely accurate. Again the potential map in \cref{potmapM2SO} is used to get the on-site potential of the oxygen, so that they can be modified with the developed method. The result is seen \cref{MS2Odevmod}. Now the band plot shows a shift of the bands downwards, just like the DFT and the valence bands have a bigger shift compared to the conduction bands. So effectively the GNR's are coupled.

\subsection{Test 4: Simulating hydrogenation of meta-NPG with symmetrically added oxygen}\label{test4}
The fourth and final test will be with the same approach as \cref{test2} only here the hydrogenation is of the meta-NPG with oxygen added symmetrically (See \cref{MS2OHOW}). Here one would expect to see QI and decoupling of the GNR's again as the system is hydrogenated, following the logic of the other tests. The DFt plot in \cref{MS2OHDFT} shows QI for both valence and conduction bands. Again the first plot produced, using the developed method, will be using the on-site modification from \cref{MS2Odevmod} as a baseline. The resulting plot can be seen in \cref{}. As expected it is identical to that of \cref{MS2Odevmod}. There is a bigger shift in the valence band and the GNR's are coupled. So the on-site potential is lowered with a value according to \cref{potmapMS2OH} and the result can be seen in \cref{MS2OHdevmod2}. As expected the plot is in good agreement with DFT, showing effective decoupling of oxygen and thus decoupling of GNR's just like the unmodified meta NPG discussed in \cref{metaparasection}. Finally by removing the hydroxide group entirely, using the developed method afterwards, the resulting band plot in \cref{MS2OHremove} is obtained. The result is also in good agreement with DFT. This again proves that the developed method can uncover the chemical effects of functionalisation with oxygen and subsequent hydrogenation in a simple manner.

\subsection{Test summary}
For the para systems, the added oxygen introduced some QI to the system. It was possible to show that the developed program could reproduce the results obtained from DFT. This did require some adjustment to the on-site potential of the added oxygen. By hydrogenation of the oxygen it was shown that the system again returned to spreading of the bands. Again by adjusting the on-site potential it was possible to obtain results very close to the DFT calculation. The results are also comparable with the ones mentioned in \cref{metaparasection}. This shows that hydrogenation of oxygen can change the system to resemble regular para-NPG, even if it has oxygens added. For the meta systems it was shown the it is possible to manipulate the system. First by having some transmission between GNR's by adding in oxygen as in \cref{test3}. Then by hydrogenating the system in\cref{test4}, getting QI and thus confinement. This turned out to be similar to un-modified meta NPG.
All in all these results give a better, intuitive understanding of what happens with the electron transport in NPG. This is because all manipulations can be followed with ease and the results are easy to interpret.
