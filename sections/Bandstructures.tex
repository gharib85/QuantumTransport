\subsection{Creating on-site Hamiltonian and hopping matrices for the system}
In order to calculate and visualise the band structure of the NPG in a localised area, the on-site Hamiltonian along with with its hopping matrices must be defined. On the premise of the Tight Binding Model, the first stepthe basic idea is to find all the nearest neighbouring atoms in the given set of atom coordinates for the on-site Hamiltonian. This is the
