\subsection{Creating on-site Hamiltonian and hopping matrices for the system}
In order to calculate and visualise the band structure of the NPG in a localised area, the on-site Hamiltonian along with with its hopping matrices must be defined. On the premise of the Tight Binding Model, the first step to find all the nearest neighbouring atoms in the given set of atom coordinates for the on-site Hamiltonian. This is because the Tight Binding model only allow hopping of electrons between nearest neighbour atoms. Practically this is done by
