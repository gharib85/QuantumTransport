\subsection{Ballistic quantum transport}
As graphene is two dimensional material that consists of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal pattern, features in such a material can approach nanometer and sub nanometer scales. Because of the small scale the electrical properties and the electrical nature of the material is greatly changed. Normal drift-diffusion curretn

The main scope of this paper is dealing with electron transport in novel nanoporous graphene devices.
When modeling such transport one needs to adress the orbital structure of carbon lattices and later this will motivate the use of tightbinding and Green's functions.
In its basic form graphene can be devided into rings of carbon atoms as shown in \cref{ring}. In the (\(x,y\))-plane the carbon atoms are bound in \(sp^2\) orbitals as shown in \cref{sp2}.

This hybradisation lock all but one valence electron for the carbon atoms. These electrons exists in a p-orbital in the \(z\)-direction.
\cref{p} shows the valence orbitals of carbon.

      \orbital[pos = {(0,3)}] {s}
      \node[above] at (0,4) {s};

			\node[above] at (6,4) {p$_z$};

\end{figure}
The last electron in the p\(_z\) orbital does not mix with the tightly bound s, p\(_x\) and p\(_y\) electrons and moves more freely. Thus these electrons have higher energies compared to the \(sp^2\) electrons and occupy states at the Fermi level. These electrons dominates transport in the graphene lattice. The p\(_z\) orbital is also known as the \(\pi\)-orbital and as such the electron lying there is called a \(\pi\)-electron. Through a carbon lattice the \(\pi\)-electrons will travel through \(\pi\)-orbitals, switching sign as they go as shown in \cref{sign}.
