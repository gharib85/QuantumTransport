# The transiesta calculation
# should NOT have any k-points
# along the graphene transport
# direction. Hence for N-electrodes
# we HAVE to manually specify the
# transiesta k-points as transiesta
# cannot decide for us!
# This is an EXTREMELY important point when performing
# calculations with semi-infinite directions that are 
# not aligned.

# This is important to terminate electrodes

# Note that a vacuum terminated bulk part will
