    "\n",
    "As this is your first example of running TranSiesta there are a few things you should know:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Any* TranSiesta calculation starts by calculating the electrode Hamiltonians and their densities.\n",
    "  - Start by defining your electrode and figure out how *long* it should be (by the end of this example you should know how)\n",
    "  - Converge $k$-points and parameters such that the electrode truly reflects your physical boundaries for the bulk electrode.\n",
    "  - As in [TB 5](../TB_05/run.ipynb) you should *always* use periodicity if allowed. Using Bloch's theorem will greatly increase throughput with little effort.\n",
    "  - Run the electrode with `siesta` executable as this `siesta --electrode`. This will create the `*.TSHS` file which is the basic ingredient used in TranSiesta/TBtrans to calculate the self-energies from the given electrode.\n",
    "  - Additionally, you can read the electrode Hamiltonian (from the `*.TSHS`) into sisl and create band-structures, just as in [TB 1](../TB_01/run.ipynb).\n",
    "2. Define your device structure by ensuring the electrode length as determined in step 1. \n",
    "  - Add a few *screening layers* to ensure a smooth potential towards the bulk electrodes, do this for all electrodes.\n",
    "  - Add the scattering part which connects the electrodes.\n",
    "3. Define the input for TranSiesta, you can with benefit use the bash-script `tselecs.sh` which will generate a default input for $N\\ge1$ electrodes and only require slight changes.\n",
    "4. Run TranSiesta\n",
    "  - Go through the output of TranSiesta to assert that it has run without error (always do this!) ((always, **always** do THIS!))\n",
    "  - Ensure the SCF has indeed converged, TranSiesta should not stop because of the maximum allowed iterations is too small. Optionally you may use this flag `SCF.MustConverge T` (the default) to make TranSiesta die if it does not converge.\n",
    "  - Ensure that the `dQ` column is close to $0$, below $0.01$ is preferable. Further, it is advised that the last couple of iterations also obey this condition.\n",
    "  - Go through the lines after:\n",
    "  \n",
    "        ```\n",
    "        ***************************\n",
    "        *  WELCOME TO TRANSIESTA  *\n",
    "        ***************************\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "        \n",
    "    which is the point where TranSiesta starts.  \n",
    "    Try and familiarize your-self with the output of TranSiesta, lots of information is printed. Some more important than others.\n",
    "    \n",
    "5. Run TBtrans. Notice that TBtrans will default to the values given to TranSiesta, so do not be worried about missing `TBT.*` flags in the input files. However, remark that TBtrans will *only* use the `TS.<>` flag if `TBT.<>` does not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "### For this example follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Run TranSiesta for the electrode:\n",
    "\n",
    "       siesta --electrode RUN_ELEC.fdf > RUN_ELEC.out\n",
    "       \n",
    "- Run TranSiesta for the device region:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- Continue by deleting all `ELEC.*` files\n",
    "- Edit `RUN_ELEC.fdf` to include the `STRUCT_ELEC_SMALL.fdf` instead of `STRUCT_ELEC.fdf`\n",
    "- Re-run the electrode calculation (`siesta --electrode RUN_ELEC.fdf > ELEC_SMALL.out`)\n",

    "Evidently TranSiesta does not allow too small electrodes as that will create an erroneous coupling to the semi-infinite directions. Luckily this may easily be inferred in the electrode output by looking for this keyword: `Internal auxiliary supercell`. The output of TranSiesta will print 3 numbers $\\langle A\\rangle \\mathrm{x} \\langle B\\rangle \\mathrm{x}\\langle C\\rangle$ which corresponds to the number of neighbouring unit-cells the primary unit-cell connects to. The important number to look for is the number corresponding to the semi-infinite direction.  \n",
    "What should this number be in order to preserve nearest-neighbour unit-cell interactions? Say, if the semi-infinite is along the $\\langle A\\rangle$ direction what should the number $\\langle A\\rangle$ (always!) be?"
