    "This tutorial is made up in consecutive examples such that one is first, introduced to the transport methodology using TBtrans. So called “tight-binding” Hamiltonians are excellent examples to understand the methodology. They are extremely simple and may be used to shed light on more complicated issues.  \n",
    "Subsequent to the understanding of sisl and TBtrans, the tutorial will show how to analyze generic output from the DFT, Siesta. In particular the calculation of band-structures, DOS and plotting real-space quantities.  \n",
    "Lastly, the tutorial presents examples of self-consistent bias calculations using TranSiesta. These are merely extensions of the same simplistic modelling used in the tight-binding calculation and we try and retrieve the same results as using sisl and TBtrans. If your interest lie only with TranSiesta, do not be tempted to skip the tight-binding, nor Siesta, exercises. By understanding the underlying methodology for simple transport problems it becomes much easier to extrapolate to more complex/larger systems!"

    "  Creation of your first tight-binding Hamiltonian for TBtrans.\n",
    "  This, again, creates a graphene device with 2 electrodes and a small scattering region.\n",
    "  After having created the electronic structure to be fed into TBtrans you will run TBtrans. Then returning to the tutorial script you will run some data-analysis using `sisl` again.\n",
