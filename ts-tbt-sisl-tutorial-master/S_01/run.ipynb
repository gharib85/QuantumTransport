    "       siesta RUN.fdf > RUN.out\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Go through the output of Siesta to get used to it, also to assert that it has runned without errors (always do this!) ((always, **always** do THIS!))\n",
    "  - Ensure the SCF has indeed converged, Siesta will, by default, die if it hasn't converged the SCF.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. Use `sisl` to read in the electronic structure (the Hamiltonian), there are several ways of doing this, for now you should try these two methods:\n",

    "         H_fdf = sisl.Hamiltonian.read('RUN.fdf')\n",
    "         H_TSHS = sisl.Hamiltonian.read('siesta.TSHS')\n",
    "         \n",
    "    print the objects and note the difference between the two objects.\n",
    "    What do you think these differences mean? (it isn't relevant for this tutorial, but it will be in later tutorials).\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Calculate the $\\Gamma$-point eigen spectrum using both above Hamiltonians (search the sisl documentation for `eigh`), are they different? If so, why, if not, why not?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Calculate the band-structure using the DFT electronic structure using `sisl`. Also calculate the band-structure using the tight-binding Hamiltonian ([TB 1](../TB_01/run.ipynb)) and compare the two.  \n",
    "*HINT*: zoom in on an energy-range from $-3$ eV to $3$ eV and plot both the DFT bands and the TB bands in the same plot.  "
